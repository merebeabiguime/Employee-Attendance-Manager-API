# Employee Management System

Employee Management System is a project developed in C# which aims to streamline employee attendance tracking and management. This system consists of both a backend, where the business logic is managed, and a frontend for the graphical interface.

## Features

- **Employee Attendance Tracking**: Employees can scan QR codes upon arrival and departure from work, allowing for efficient attendance management.
- **Admin Interface**: Administrators can access an interface to manage all employee scans and perform administrative tasks.
- **MySQL Database**: The system utilizes MySQL as the backend database for storing employee information and attendance records.
- **Authentication System**: Firebase authentication is integrated to ensure secure access control for both employees and administrators.
